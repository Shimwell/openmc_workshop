## Task 6 - DPA

Please allow 15 minutes for this task.

Expected outputs from this task are also in the [presentation](https://slides.com/openmc_workshop/neutronics_workshop#/7).

In this task you will use OpenMC to run simple neutronics simulations to tally DPA using a cell tally.

**Learning Outcomes**

- Damage energy deposited can be found with the OpenMC MT 444 tally.
- Cell volumes can be found using the stochastic volume method.
- Post tally calculations can be performed to convert neutronics numbers into something more useful.
